My Fifth and final Hackathon where we failed miserably because of unknown reasons, but trust me we enjoyed so much :)

### HackIndore 2.0
#### Oct 04, 2019

My Fourth Hackathon where we again failed to win, maybe because there was no Machine Learning (that's what judges asked T-T)

### Void Hack: Indore Hackathon
#### Apr 05, 2019

Third hackathon, but this time only 2 of them were there and that too working with Blockchain which we had no idea of, crazy times but worth it

### Smart India Hackathon
#### Mar 28, 2018

This was my very First Hackathon (I was in Second Year) and being a Team Lead we went to Grand Finale and came in Top 10

- Showcased Django web application solving one of the competition's problem statements
- Led development and presentation of the solution
- During that time, I had 101 fever and survived with paracetamol, crazy times
